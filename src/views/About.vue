    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a front-end developer with a background in electrical and electronic
      engineering. With over two years' experience as a technical executive, I
      have killer attention to detail, which means I see issues arising more
      quickly than others. With the proven ability as a critical thinker, I'm
      able to devise effective and efficient workflows. To become more creative
      and to explore my ability to turn people's wonderful ideas into reality, I
      decided to move into software engineering, the industry with a lifetime of
      exciting challenges.
